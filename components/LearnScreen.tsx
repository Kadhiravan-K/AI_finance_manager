It suggests allocating 50% of your after-tax income to Needs (housing, utilities, groceries), 30% to Wants (dining out, hobbies), and 20% to Savings & Debt Repayment. It's a great starting point for taking control of your money." },
    { title: "What is an Emergency Fund?", content: "An emergency fund is a stash of money set aside to cover unexpected financial emergencies, like a job loss or medical bill. A good rule of thumb is to save 3-6 months' worth of essential living expenses in a high-yield savings account." },
    { title: "Saving vs. Investing: What's the Difference?", content: "Saving is for short-term goals and emergencies; it's typically low-risk and low-return (like a savings account). Investing is for long-term goals like retirement; it involves taking on more risk for the potential of higher returns (like stocks or mutual funds)." },
    { title: "Understanding Your Credit Score", content: "A credit score is a number that represents your creditworthiness to lenders. It's based on factors like payment history, amounts owed, and length of credit history. A higher score makes it easier to get loans and credit cards with better interest rates." },
